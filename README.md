# Crate: Emacs Lisp Collections

A selection of specialized collections for Emacs Lisp

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/julianbetz/elisp-crate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/julianbetz/elisp-crate)

The `crate` package requires Emacs >= 24.1 and `cl-lib` >= 0.6.1.  `cl-lib` is
included in Emacs >= 24.3, but has to be installed for earlier versions.  It can
be found on [ELPA](http://elpa.gnu.org/packages/cl-lib-0.6.1.el).
