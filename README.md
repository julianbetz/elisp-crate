A selection of specialized collections for Emacs Lisp

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/julianbetz/elisp-crate.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.com/julianbetz/elisp-crate)

The `crate` package requires Emacs >= 25.1. The current version is not stable
and the API may be subject to breaking changes.

The package currently contains doubly linked lists.
